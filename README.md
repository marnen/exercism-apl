# exercism-apl
APL track for Exercism (targeting ISO/GNU APL).

We are making use of GNU APL's testcase feature. To run tests, go to any exercise directory and run `apl -T *.tc`.

Note that all implementation files (`*.apl`) need a shebang line, or else GNU APL won't load them properly. Yes, I know this is not ideal.
